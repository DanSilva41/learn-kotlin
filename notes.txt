    - It's final by default
    - To make a class inheritable, mark it as `open`

* Iterate over a range
    - until -> half-open range: does not include the final value

* Interesting
    - Extension functions
    - Object expressions
    - Companion objects
    - Sealed classes and interfaces
    - Way with Generics (cool)
    - Inline classes
    - Delegation
